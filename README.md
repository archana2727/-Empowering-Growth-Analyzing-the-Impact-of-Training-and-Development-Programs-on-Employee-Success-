Managerial usefulness of Study

Improved staff performance - An employee who receives the necessary training is able to do his or her job. Training will give the employee more insight into their responsibilities within their role, and increase their selfesteem. This confidence will improve their overall performance and this can only benefit the company. Skilled employees and in addition to changing standards in the industry help your company hold a position as a leader and a strong competitor in the industry.

Improved employee satisfaction and ethics - Investing in company training shows employees that they are valued. Training creates a supportive work environment. Employees may gain access to training that they would not otherwise be able to or will seek out for themselves. Employees who feel valued and challenged for training opportunities may feel more satisfied with their job.

Dealing with Weaknesses - Most employees will have some weaknesses in their work skills. The training program allows you to hone those skills each job needs to develop. The development plan brings all employees to the next level so that all have the same skills and knowledge. This helps to minimize any weak links in the 20 company that rely too much on a person to complete basic tasks. Providing the necessary training creates a fullyfledged staff and staff who can hold each other as required, work in teams or work independently without ongoing assistance and supervision.

Consistency - A strong training and development program ensures that employees have consistent experience and background knowledge. Consistency is very important in the company's basic policies and procedures. All employees need to know the expectations and procedures within the company. Increased success in processes leads to a financial gain for the company.

Increasing productivity and compliance with quality standards - Productivity tends to increase as the company uses training courses. Increased efficiency in the programs will ensure the success of the project which will improve the company's profitability and potential market share.

Increased innovation and innovation - Continuous training and skills development of staff can promote the arts. New ideas can be developed as a direct result of training and development.
Reduced employee benefits - Workers may feel valued when they are invested and as a result, they are less likely to change employers. Training and development is seen as an additional benefit to the company. Rental costs are reduced due to staff retention.

Improve company reputation and profile - Having a strong and effective training strategy helps to improve the quality of your employer and make your company a consideration for graduates and mid-career transitions. The training also makes the company more attractive to potential newcomers who want to develop their skills and opportunities related to those new skills. Training can be of any kind that is consistent with the work or responsibilities of the individual, and can be done in any appropriate way.

Type of research and research design

Research is defined as the work of a person based on the use of ingenuity in investigating a matter. The main purpose of the research used is to discover, interpret, and develop methods and systems for the development of human knowledge in many scientific matters of our planet and the universe. It is exploring and is often driven by research curiosity, interest, and sensitivity. It is done without any realistic conclusion in mind, although there may be unintended consequences pointing to practical application.

Types of research:-

To achieve the purpose of the research, the design of descriptive research was adopted to collect data from consumers of different products. Descriptive research simply describes things like the characteristics of consumers who use the product. Descriptive research is usually about determining how often the same thing happens. This research is usually guided by the first hypothesis.

Data collection methods :-

For any research these two types of data are necessary:

1. Primary data
2. Secondary data

Primary Data :
The tool is used to gather the necessary information for employees and to communicate, employees personally. Key data helps us to identify employees 'behavior, address the impact that has helped me to identify employees' attitudes towards the training program and the effectiveness of the training program in the
organization. In this project the main data is collected in four ways:
By observation, In consultation (Heads of Department and Management), Inquiries and sampling process

Secondary Data :
Secondary data is collected from various sources within the organization such as the Organization's website, Past Company records, Library books, Internet, annual reports, consulting management staff and marketing managers

Sampling :-

“Sampling can be defined as the total selection or totally based on a referendum decision on the total amount. “The sample is used for research and research on various issues affecting production management, time and movement studies, market research, various accounting and financial fields and so on.

Sample size

This refers to the number of items to be selected from the universe to constitute a sample size. In this research the sample size constitute 50 employees in the organization.

Methods of sampling

Simple random sampling technique is to be used in this project. A randomly selected sample from a larger sample or population ,giving all the individuals in the sample an equal chance to be chosen. In a simple random sample, individuals are chosen at random and not more than once to prevent a bias that would negatively affect the validity of the result of the experiment.

Statistical Tools

Statistical techniques are to obtain findings and average information in logical sequence from the raw data collected. After tabulation of data research have used the following quantitative technique.

• Percentage analysis
• Bar Diagrams

Percentage analysis

Percentage refers to a specific type of measurement. This method is used as a comparison between two or more data services. Percentage is used for fixed relationships. Percentage may also be used to compare related terries, distribution of two or more data services Bar drawings. A bar graph or bar chart is used to represent data visually using bars of different lengths or lengths.

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

Organization is the process of combining work which individuals or groups has to perform with the facilities necessary for its execution, that the duties so performed provide the best channels
for efficient, systematic, positive and coordinated application of the available effort. HRM is the planning organizing directing and controlling of the procurement, development,
compensation, integration, maintenance of human capital of an organization to achieve individual, organizational and societal objectives.

HRM Model
The model developed by American Society for Training and development (ASTD) identifies nine human resource areas:

1. Training and Development
2 Organization Development
3. Organization/Job design
4. Human Resource planning
5. Selection and Staffing
6. Personnel Research and Information Systems
7. Compensation/Benefits
8. Employee Assistance
9. Union/ Labor Relations.
The purpose of training is to achieve a change in behavior of those trained and to enable them to do their job better in order to achieve this objective. Any training programmer should try to bring changes in:

• Knowledge- It helps a trainee to know facts, policies, procedures and rules pertaining to his job.
• Skills-It helps him to increase his technical and manual efficiency necessary to do the job and
• Attitude- It molds his behaviors towards his co-workers and supervisors and creates a sense of responsibility in the trainee. Training is a short term process utilizing a systematic and organized procedure by which nonmanagerial persons learn technical knowledge and skills for a definite purpose.

Need for Training

Training is required on account of the following reasons.

1. Job requirements
The employee selected for a job might lack the qualifications required to perform the job effectively. New and inexperience employees requires detailed introduction for effective performance on the job. In some cases the past experience, attitudes and behavior patterns of experienced persons may be in appropriate for new organization.
2. Technological Changes The technology is changing fast. Increased use of fast changing techniques requires training in new technology. New jobs utilizing latest technology require new skills. Both new and old skills require training.
3. Organizational Viability In order to survive and grow an organization must continuously adopt itself to changing environment. With increasing economic liberalization and globalization in India, Business firms are experiencing international competition. So the firms must upgrade their capabilities. An organization must build up a second line of command through training in order to meet the future needs for human resources.
4. Internal Mobility Training becomes necessary when an employee moves from one job to another due to promotion or transfer. Thus this is an even present need for training people so that new and changed techniques may be taken advantage and improvements in old methods are effected. Need for training has increased due to growing complexity of jobs, increasing professional management, growing uncertainties in the environment, global competition, growing aspirations vast untapped human potential, ever increasing gaps between plans and results and suboptimal performance levels.

4. Training enables an employee to adapt to changes in the work procedures and methods.
5. An employee can develop himself and earn quick promotion.
6. Training develops new knowledge and skills which remains permanently with him.

Types of Training

Training is required for several purposes. Accordingly training programmes may be the
following types.

Orientation Training/Induction Training

Induction training seeks to adjust newly appointed employees to the work environment. Every new employee needs to be made fully familiar with his job, his supervisor and subordinates with the
rules and regulations of the organization. The induction training creates self confidence in new employees.

Job training

It refers to the training provided with a view to increase the knowledge and skills for improving performance of the job. Employees may be taught the correct methods of handling equipment and
machines used in the job. Such training helps to reduce accidents, waste and in efficiency in performance of the job.

Safety training

Promotional training

It involves training of existing employees to enable them to perform high level jobs. Employees with potential are selected and they are given training before their promotion. So that they do not find difficulty to shoulder the highest responsibilities of the new positions to which they are promoted. Refresh is training When the existing techniques become obsolete due to development of better techniques, employees have to be trained in use of new methods and techniques. Refresh is training is designed to revive and refresh knowledge and update the skills of existing employees.

Remedial Training
Remedial training is arranged to overcome the shortcoming in the behavior and performance of old employees. Remedial training shall be conducted by psychological experts.

SYTEMETIC APPROCH TO TRAINING

The flow chart given below shows various stages of systematic approach to training and development.
Flow chart 4.1 : Systematic approach to training

Identifying training needs

All training needs must be related to the specific needs of organization an individual employees. A training program is launched after the training needs are assessed and identified
clearly. The effectiveness of a training program can be judged only with the help of training needs identified in advance.

The training needs can be identified though following types of analysis.

1. Organizational Analysis
It involves a study of the entire organization in terms of its objectives, its resources, resource allocation and utilization, growth potential and its environment. The organizational analysis includes the analysis of

• Short term and long term objectives of the firm.
• Allocation and efficient utilization of human resources to meet the operational targets.
• Organizational Climate including the management’s attitude towards employee Development.
• Environmental Scanning to identify the factors affecting organization which it can control and the constraints which it cannot.

2. Task role / Operational Analysis
It is systematic and detailed analysis of jobs to identify job contents, the knowledge, skills and aptitudes required and the work behavior. Attention is paid to tasks to be performed, methods used, the way employees have learnt these techniques and performance standards required is analyzed in this stage. The purpose of operation analysis is to decide what should be taught.

3. Manpower Analysis
In this analysis the persons to be trained and the changes required in the knowledge, skills and attitude of an employee is determined. First of all, it is necessary to decide whether performance of employee is below standard and training needed. Secondly it is decided whether employee is capable of being trained. Thirdly, the specific areas in which employee requires training. Lastly, whether training will improve employee’s performance or not is determined. Training can be relevant and viable if the three types of analysis given above are carried out on
continuously.

Designing a training Program

Once the objectives and policies of training are decided, appropriate training program can be designed and conducted. Decisions on the following items are required for this purpose.

1. Responsibility of training

The responsibility of the training program has to be shared among

a) The top management
b) The Personnel department
c) The line supervisors
d) The employees who should provide feedback and suggestions

2. Selecting and motivating target group

The type of training method to be used will depend upon the type of persons to be trained. So it is necessary to decide in advance who are to be trained workers, supervisors or executives. The
employees will be interested in training if they believe that it will benefit them personally. A climate conducive for learning has to be created through physical and psychological environment.

3. Preparing Trainers

The success of a training program depends to a great extent upon the instructors or the resource persons. The trainer must know both the job to be taught and how to teach it. He should
have an aptitude for teaching and should employ right training techniques.

4. Selecting and motivating target group

10. Developing training package

This step involves deciding the content of training, designing support materials for training and choosing appropriate training methods. It may involve the specific instructions and procedures for doing a job. In addition to the contents, methods and time period it also includes budget. Supporting materials may include detailed syllabus, study notes, case studies, pamphlets, charts, manuals, brochures and movie slides. 

Conducting the training
This is the action phase of training. His e the trainer tells, demonstrates and illustrates in order to put over the knowledge and operations. However, before it a learner should be put to ease. It is necessary to explain why he is being taught to develop his interest in training. Instructions should
be clear and complete. Key points shall be stressed upon and one point should be trained at a time. Trainees should be encouraged to ask questions.

Follow up and Evaluation

In the evaluation step, the effectiveness of training program is assessed. The feedback generated through follow up will help to reveal weaknesses or errors if any; Necessary corrective action can be taken. If necessary training can be repeated until trainees learns whatever has been taught to
him. It also helps in designing future training program.

Training Methods
The training methods employed for training of operatives may be described under.

1. On-the-job training (OJT)

In this method trainees are placed on regular job and taught the skills necessary to perform it. The trainee learns under the supervision of superior or instructor. It is also called learning by doing.

2. Vestibule training

In this method a training center called vestibule is setup and actual job conditions are stimulated. Expert trainers are employed to provide training with machines that are identical to those used in work place.

3. Apprentice training

In this method the theoretical instruction and practical learning are provided to trainees in training institutes. The aim is to develop all-round craftsmen. Generally a stipend is paid during training.

4. Class room training

Under this method training is provided to company class room. Lectures, case studies group discussions and audio visual aids are used to explain knowledge and skills to employees. Class
room training is useful for teaching concepts and problem solving. It is also useful for orientation training and safety training.

5. Internship training

It is a joint program of training in which educational institutions and business firms cooperate. Selected candidates carry on regular studies for prescribed period. They also work in some
factory or office to acquire practical knowledge and skills. This method helps to provide good balance between theory and practice.
 
Evaluating Effectiveness Of Training

Need for Evaluation

It is necessary to evaluate the extent to which training program have achieved the goals for which they were designed. Such evaluation will provide useful information about effectiveness
of training as well as about design of future training program. The evaluation of training provides useful data on the basis of their relevance of training and integration with other
functions of human resource management can be judged. Concept of Training Effectiveness Training effectiveness is the degree to which trainees are able to learn and apply the knowledge
and skills acquired in the training program. It depends on the attitudes, interests, values and expectations of trainees and training environment. A training program is likely to be more effective when trainees want to learn, are involve in their jobs, have career strategies. Contents of the training program, and ability and motivation of trainers also determine training effectiveness.

Evaluation Criteria

According to Hamblin effectiveness of the training can be measured in terms of following criteria:

i. Reactions: A training program can be evaluated in terms of the trainees ‟reactions to the objectives, contents and methods of training. In case the considered the program worthwhile and liked it, the training the training can be considered effective.

ii. Learning: The extent to which the trainees have learnt the desired knowledge and skills during the training period is useful basis for evaluating training effectiveness.

iii. Behavior: Improvement in the job behavior of the trainees reflects the manner an extent to which learning has been applied to the job.

iv. Results: The ultimate result in terms of productivity, quality improvement, cost reduction, accident reduction, reduction in labor

Methods of Evaluation

Several methods can be employed to collect data on the outcomes of training.

1. The opinion and judgment of trainers, superiors and peers
2. Evaluation forms filled up by trainees
3. Questionnaires filled up by trainees
4. Giving written tests to trainees
5. Arranging structured interviews with trainees
6. Comparing performance of trainees on the job before and after training
7. Studying profiles and career development charts of trainees
8. Measuring the levels of productivity, wastage, Costs, absenteeism and employee turnover after training
9. Trainees‟ comments and reactions during training period
10. Cost benefits analysis of the training program.

Setting training objectives and policy

The overall aim of a training program is to fill in the gap between the existing and the desired pool of knowledge, skills and aptitudes. Objectives of training express the gap between the present and the desired performance levels.

The main objectives of training may be defined as follows

i. To impart to new entrants the basic knowledge and skills for efficient performance definite task.

ii. To assist employees function more efficiently by exposing them to latest concepts, information and techniques and developing the skills they require in the particularjob.

iii. To build up a second line of competent officers and prepare them to occupy more responsible positions.

iv. To broaden the narrow minds of senior managers through interchange of experience within and outside so as to correct the narrow outlook caused due to overspecialization. While setting training objectives, following criteria may be used.

a) Nature and size of the group trained

b) Roles and tasks to be coined out by target group

c) Relevance, applicability and compatibility of training to the work situation

d) Identification of the behavior whose changes required

e) Defining the existing and desired behavior in terms of ratio, frequency, quality of interaction, repetitiveness, innovations and supervisions, etc.

f) Operational results to be achieved through training e.g. Productivity, cost, down time, creativity, turnover, etc.

g) Indicators to be used in determining changes from existing to the desired level in terms of ratio and frequency.

In order to achieve the training objectives, an appropriate training policy is necessary. A training policy represents the commitment of top management to employee training. It consists of rules and procedures concerning training.

A sound training policy defines the following issues.

The results expected to be achieved through training
i. The responsibility of the training function
ii. The priorities for training
iii. The type of training required
iv. The time and place of training
v. The payments paid to the employees during the training period
vi. The outside agencies to be associated with the training
vii. Relationship of training of the companies labor policy

OPERATION MANAGEMENT

Operations management focuses on carefully managing the processes to produce and distribute products and services. Major, overall activities often include product creation, development, production and distribution. (These activities are also associated with Product and Service Management.) Related activities include managing purchases, inventory control, quality control, storage, logistics and evaluations of processes. A great deal of focus is on efficiency and effectiveness of processes. Therefore, operations management often includes substantial measurement and analysis of internal processes. Ultimately, the nature of how operations management is carried out in an organization depends very much on the nature of the products or services in the
organization, for example, on retail, manufacturing or wholesale. Companies spend millions wringing every bit of inefficiency from supply chains. But, there is a hidden trove of efficiency and value that leading companies are just beginning to consider. Supply chain migration from lean and functional to agile and customized. Improving supply-chain management to gain a competitive edge. A misaligned supply chain can lead to higher costs, lower quality and poor customer service. An Investigative Study in Small and Medium Enterprises. It appears that the notions on supply chain management may only be indirectly associated with the issues surrounding consumer behaviours toward maintaining and/or otherwise pushing customer satisfaction. The
forces of globalization and ever flattening world are exerting renewed pressure on global supply chains. It is time that organizations counter supply chain disruptions by building solid 'sense and respond' capabilities. Four cardinal principles for maximizing payback from supply chain technology investments. This paper examines the impact of e-business. The complexities of getting material ordered, manufactured and delivered overload most supply chain management (SCM) systems. Eradicating the "high-inventory-poor-service level" problem. Unlocking Value from E-Supply Management. Despite the "e," e-supply management is about much more than technology. Five steps can help businesses make the most of their efforts. A few farsighted finance executives are managing their supply chain as a virtual corporation, finding innovative ways to reduce costs and increase earnings. Flow Manufacturing is Essential to Competitive Supply Chain Management. Many companies are not aware of how their supply chains are performing or even what supply chain they're in. Specific assessment criteria based on the Six Levels of Supply Chain Excellence and a strategic assessment methodology can help them determine how their supply chain is performing and thus plot a course for improvement. Major shifts in global business conditions are radically altering input costs and risk. In response, companies must realign their supply chains, including: rethinking product formulation and packaging, restructuring the supply chain network and footprint, and realigning the role of suppliers and third parties. Now that Supply Chain Management has entered the consciousness of manufacturing managers, we are experiencing the inevitable rush to apply a software solution to implementation of a fully integrated chain of activities from the top to the bottom of the materials flow. But supply chain management is much more than software.
